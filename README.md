# Project-2--ML-Linear-Regression-Module
This program is my second project for data science progression. I made a basic linear regression model that finds a more exact line than the equation we typically use. (y=Ax+B is an approximation). This model produces exact results and graphs them in red. Our approximation is graphed in green, and our data points are blue.
